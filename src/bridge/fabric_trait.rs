// FABRIC TRAIT — Spec 8 §7 surface
//
// The trait surface Nabu and downstream consumers (Spec 6 immune system,
// Spec 7 agent comms, team-node) call into. The concrete implementation
// is `BridgeFabric` (this module). Subscriptions, P53, and decay tick
// methods are present in the trait but their full bodies land in
// Steps 4 (subscriptions) and 6 (P53) — for now they return
// `WriteError::FabricInternal("not yet implemented in v1")`.
